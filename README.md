## ‚öôÔ∏è Project setup:
To run this project locally do the following after cloning it:

### Frontend:
Run ```npm i to install``` node dependencies
Run ```ng serve``` to start project on localhost:4200


### Backend:

The backend app is split into the following microservices:

![microservices](https://github.com/gemasegarra/play-with-friends/blob/master/frontend/src/assets/microservices.png)

Eureka service: runs on port:8761
Edge service: runs on port:8080
User service: runs on port:8081
Matching service: runs on port:8082
Games service: runs on port:8083
Email service: runs on port:8084
Auth service: runs on port:8085

**Prerrequisites:**

Don't forget to setup your own SQL server and seed the database with this SQL script. All microservices will use the same database, called demo. Make sure you have the same values you'll find in the application.properties file of each microservice or properly change them according to your configuration.

Open each service folder separately

Run ```mvn spring-boot:run```

‚ùóÔ∏è It is important that you start first the eureka service project so the other microservices work
